For changing Duty Cycle:

 # Address, hex Data, Function
 1 0xA1 0x00 to 0xFF Set PWM0 Initial Duty Cycle value [7:0]. Default: 0x00
 2 0xA2 0x01 Set I2C trigger for PWM0 to Update duty cycle value

Version update
==============

Run

  echo \#define FWVERSION \"`date +%s ; date -Iseconds`\" >version.h

to update version.h .

LED Matrix
==========

Connect it up and enable power - the polarity doesn't seem to matter
for this device. Then use a DATA command as follows:

  select 0
  write1 c0 5

and you should get one row of fully-lit green LEDs and one partially-lit
row. The value "5" can be from 0 to 9, giving you 0-3 rows of LEDs lit
with interpolation. If you are typing these by hand you can abbreviate
"write1" to "w".

If you do

  select 1
  write1 c1 1

everything lights red;

  write1 c1 2

everything lights magenta; 3=blue, 4=cyan, 5=pale green, 6=green,
7=yellow, 8=orange, 9=red, 0a=white... and lots more colours
that don't appear to be in a logical order. (According to the MODE
data it only goes up to 0x0a, so maybe it is reading off the end of a
table in ROM!)

The most flexible mode is mode 2.

  select 2
  write1 c2 12 23 34 45 12 23 34 45 12

gives a random pattern of dull colours

  write1 c2 67 72 78 82 89 92 9a a4 aa

gives some random bright ones. 0xaa is the highest colour number but
again higher numbers do do something. The first hex digit seems to be
the brightness and the second hex digit the basic colour: compare

  write1 c2 1a 2a 3a 4a 5a 6a 7a 8a 9a

(shades of white) and

  write1 c2 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9

(all the basic colours at full brightness).

Mode 3 (TRANS) controls transitions. If you do

  write1 c3 1

you get a row-by-row animated transition from one state to the
next;

  write1 c3 2

does a fade to black and fade back up. You can get some bizarre flashing
effects by fading through non-existent colours (above 0xaa), which may
or may not be deliberate.

Note that mode 2 reads out with the data in row-reversed order.

Colour sensor
=============

Power it backwards. In other words, you have to do

  plimit 1   <- to allow full power
  set -1     <- power up with negative polarity

then

  select 0

and you will get some numbers which appear to be colour indices.

  select 1

gives you something corresponding to distance or possibly reflected intensity.

Ultrasound sensor
=================

  Power it up backwards:

  plimit 1
  set -1

Then select the LIGHT mode:

  select 5

and now you can write 4 bytes as follows:

  write1 c5 pp qq rr ss

which will light up the LEDs. With the LEGO logo the right way up and
from the robot's point of view the values are:

  pp=right-eye-upper
  qq=left-eye-upper
  rr=right-eye-lower
  ss=left-eye-lower

and the numbers can range from 0 to 64 hex (100 decimal).

Examples
========

These examples assume you have a small motor connected to each of ports 0 and 1.
In all cases set "plimit 1" and (if wanted) "echo 1".
